KUsistant is our computer engineering design project. 
It is a personal student assistant. 
It aims to help students meet their academic and personal needs. 
With KUsistant you can easily learn your GPA or weather of Ko√ß without having to navigate around different websites. 
To retrieve this information KUsistant understands its users' inputs and communicates with various APIs to get the necessary information. 
KUsistant also has the future of small talk, so you can talk with KUsistant and it also can tell you some very bad dad jokes.

It consists of 2 screens which are login and chat.

Login Screen:
- In this screen, the user is prompted to log in to their Blackboard and KUSIS accounts. Once they are logged into their accounts, their cookies will be retrieved
and saved in the MongoDB database with their specific userID for their requests on the chat screen.
